# Damla Discord Bot
This is my private Discord Bot

There are differend ways to create a Discord Bot. In the way I did you can use commands with events together and they work fine. I'm hosting this script in Replit. Damla was written in Turkish, so I had to change the basics. I have tried to make it understandable and left the rest as it is.
